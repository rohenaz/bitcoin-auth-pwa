Machine-readable project information for AI assistants and LLMs.

## What is LLMs.txt?

LLMs.txt is a standardized format that provides AI assistants with structured information about your project, 
making it easier for them to understand your codebase and provide accurate assistance.

## Our LLMs.txt File

You can access our LLMs.txt file at: [/llms.txt](/llms.txt)

### What's Included
Our LLMs.txt file contains comprehensive information about:

#### Project Overview
- Technology stack and architecture
- Core features and capabilities
- Key concepts for AI understanding

#### Component Library (bigblocks)
- Complete component reference
- Usage examples for all 89+ components
- Integration patterns and best practices

#### API Reference
- All available API routes
- Authentication endpoints
- User and profile management

#### Development Guide
- Setup instructions
- Environment variables
- Development commands

#### Security & Architecture
- Bitcoin-based authentication concepts
- Multi-profile system explanation
- BAP (Bitcoin Attestation Protocol) details

## Benefits for AI Assistants

When working with our codebase, AI assistants can:

1. **Understand Context**: Quickly grasp the Bitcoin-based authentication approach
2. **Provide Accurate Code**: Generate code that follows our patterns and conventions
3. **Suggest Components**: Recommend appropriate bigblocks components for tasks
4. **Debug Issues**: Better understand the architecture when troubleshooting
5. **Follow Best Practices**: Implement features using established patterns

## Example AI Interactions

With our LLMs.txt file, AI assistants can help with:

```tsx title="ai-suggested-code.tsx"
// AI can suggest proper component usage
import { LoginForm, BitcoinAuthProvider } from 'bigblocks';

// AI understands this is Bitcoin-based auth, not traditional passwords
<BitcoinAuthProvider config={{ apiUrl: '/api' }}>
  <LoginForm mode="signin" onSuccess={handleAuth} />
</BitcoinAuthProvider>
```

## Integration with Development Tools

Our LLMs.txt works with:

- **Claude Code**: Direct integration for codebase assistance
- **GitHub Copilot**: Enhanced context for code suggestions
- **Cursor**: Improved AI pair programming
- **VS Code Continue**: Better code completion
- **Custom AI Tools**: Any LLM-powered development tool

## Best Practices for LLMs.txt

Based on our implementation:

1. **Keep it Current**: Regular updates when adding features
2. **Be Comprehensive**: Include architecture, components, and patterns
3. **Provide Examples**: Show actual usage patterns
4. **Document Concepts**: Explain unique approaches (like Bitcoin auth)
5. **Include Context**: Help AI understand the "why" behind decisions

This machine-readable documentation ensures that AI assistants can provide the most accurate and helpful 
guidance when working with Bitcoin Auth PWA and the bigblocks component library.
