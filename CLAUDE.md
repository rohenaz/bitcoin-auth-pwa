## üöÄ Bitcoin Auth Component Library

A production-ready component library for Bitcoin-based authentication has been created in `/components/bitcoin-auth/`. This library provides reusable, composable components that abstract away the complexity of Bitcoin authentication, similar to how Stripe's components handle payments.

### Component Library Features:
1. **AuthFlowOrchestrator** - Complete authentication flow management (signin/signup/restore)
2. **OAuthRestoreFlow** - OAuth backup restoration with password decryption
3. **AuthLayout Components** - Page-level layouts (CenteredLayout, LoadingLayout, ErrorLayout, etc.)
4. **FileImport** - Advanced file import with validation for encrypted/unencrypted backups
5. **OAuthConflictModal** - Handles OAuth account conflicts with transfer/switch options
6. **OAuthProviders** - OAuth provider selection with customizable icons
7. **Modal** - Reusable modal component with animations
8. **Complete Storybook Documentation** - All components have comprehensive stories

### Using the Component Library:
```tsx
import { BitcoinAuthProvider, AuthFlowOrchestrator } from '@/components/bitcoin-auth';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BitcoinAuthProvider>
      <AuthFlowOrchestrator
        flowType="unified"
        enableOAuth={true}
        onSuccess={(user) => console.log('Authenticated:', user)}
      />
    </BitcoinAuthProvider>
  );
}
```

### Development:
- **Storybook**: Run `bun storybook` to view all components
- **Build**: Always run `bun run build` after changes to ensure TypeScript compilation
- **Export**: All components are exported from `/components/bitcoin-auth/index.ts`

### shadcn/ui Registry Integration (Planned):
The library includes registry configuration for potential shadcn/ui style distribution:
- `registry/registry.json` - Component registry configuration
- `cli/bitcoin-auth-ui.ts` - CLI tool for adding components (like `npx shadcn-ui add`)
- Ready for npm publishing as `bitcoin-auth-ui`

## ‚úÖ Dashboard Fully Restored

The dashboard has been completely restored with all missing functionality while maintaining multi-profile support and React Query integration. The dashboard now features:

### Restored Features:
1. **DeviceLinkQR Component** - QR code generation for linking new devices ‚úÖ
2. **Quick Actions Section** - Including "Edit BAP Profile" and "Security Settings" links ‚úÖ
3. **Account Status Card** - Real-time status indicators for authentication, backup, and BAP profile ‚úÖ
4. **Security Notice** - Prominent security reminder with proper styling ‚úÖ
5. **Profile Image Display** - Clean profile image presentation ‚úÖ
6. **Vercel-style Layout** - Modern three-column grid with proper spacing and borders ‚úÖ
7. **Navigation Header** - Clean navigation with profile switching ‚úÖ
8. **React Query Integration** - All data fetching uses React Query for optimal performance ‚úÖ

### Design System:
- **Vercel-style Dark Theme** - Clean, minimal design with subtle borders and lots of whitespace
- **Consistent Color Palette** - Gray-based with minimal accent colors (green for status, amber for warnings)
- **Outlined Containers** - Border-based design instead of filled boxes
- **Proper Typography** - Clean hierarchy with appropriate font weights and sizes
- **Responsive Design** - Works across all screen sizes with adaptive layouts

### Multi-Profile Support:
The dashboard maintains full multi-profile functionality:
- Dynamic routing with `/dashboard/[bapId]` support
- Profile switching via ProfileSwitcher component
- Per-profile data fetching and caching
- Secure profile ownership verification

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
bun dev          # Start development server with Turbopack
npm run dev      # Alternative with npm

# Production
bun run build    # Build for production
bun start        # Start production server

# Code Quality
bun lint         # Run ESLint
npm run lint     # Alternative with npm
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Always Run Build After Changes

**ALWAYS run `bun run build` after making code changes to ensure:**
- TypeScript compilation succeeds
- No import/export errors
- ESLint rules are satisfied
- The production build works correctly

If the build fails, fix all errors before considering the task complete.

## Architecture Overview

This is a Bitcoin-based authentication PWA where users' Bitcoin keypairs ARE their identity. No traditional usernames/passwords.

### Authentication Flow

1. **New Users**: Generate BAP identity ‚Üí Encrypt with password ‚Üí Store locally ‚Üí Link OAuth for cloud backup
2. **Returning Users (Same Device)**: Decrypt local backup with password ‚Üí Use keys for auth
3. **Returning Users (New Device)**: OAuth login ‚Üí Retrieve encrypted backup ‚Üí Decrypt with password
4. **OAuth Provider Linking**: Special flow that bypasses NextAuth session creation:
   - Must be signed in with credentials provider (Bitcoin keys)
   - From Settings ‚Üí `/api/auth/link-provider` ‚Üí OAuth sign-in
   - Callback to `/api/auth/link-provider/callback` (NOT NextAuth callback)
   - Creates OAuth mapping without creating new session
   - Returns to existing credentials session with success/error params

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **BAP (Bitcoin Attestation Protocol)**: Used for hierarchical deterministic identity management. User identities are BAP master backups containing xprv and identity attributes.
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Private keys NEVER leave the browser unencrypted. All encryption happens client-side using `bitcoin-backup`.
- **OAuth as Storage**: OAuth providers (Google/GitHub/X) are used ONLY as "anchors" to store/retrieve encrypted backups, NOT for authentication.
- **Signature Authentication**: Every API request includes `X-Auth-Token` header with Bitcoin signature (using `bitcoin-auth` library).
- **Redis Storage**: User profiles, BAP data, and encrypted backups stored in Upstash Redis with structured keys.

### Critical Implementation Details

- **Session Storage**: Decrypted BAP backup stored in `sessionStorage` with key `decryptedBackup`
- **Local Storage**: Encrypted backup stored in `localStorage` with key `encryptedBackup`
- **BAP Identity Access**: Extract identity from backup using: `new BAP(backup.xprv)` ‚Üí `bap.getId(ids[0])` ‚Üí `exportMemberBackup()`
- **Time-Bound Tokens**: Authentication tokens have 10-minute validity window
- **Block Height Tracking**: BAP profiles tracked with block height for updates
- **JWT Session Strategy**: Uses JWT tokens, NOT database sessions (no adapter needed)
- **OAuth Mapping**: Links OAuth providers to BAP IDs via `oauth:{provider}:{providerAccountId}` ‚Üí `bapId`
- **Address Mapping**: Maps Bitcoin addresses to BAP IDs for unpublished profiles via `addr:{address}` ‚Üí `{id, block}`
- **OAuth State Management**: OAuth linking uses crypto-secure state stored in Redis with 10-minute expiry
- **Environment Validation**: Server-side only via `typeof window === 'undefined'` check
- **Enabled Providers**: Configured in `lib/env.ts` as `ENABLED_PROVIDERS` constant (currently google, github)
- **Device Linking**: Time-limited tokens stored in Redis as `device-link:{token}` with 10-minute expiry
- **Dashboard Routing**: Uses Next.js 15 async params with catch-all route `/dashboard/[[...bapId]]`

### API Routes

- `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`: NextAuth handler with custom Bitcoin credentials provider
- `/api/auth/link-provider`: GET initiates OAuth linking flow (bypasses NextAuth)
- `/api/auth/link-provider/callback`: GET handles OAuth callback for linking (creates mapping only)
- `/api/backup`: GET/POST encrypted backups (GET by OAuth ID or BAP ID, POST to store backup)
- `/api/backup/status`: GET backup status for current user
- `/api/bap`: GET cached BAP profiles from Redis by address (includes unpublished profiles)
- `/api/device-link/generate`: POST generates a time-limited QR code for device linking
- `/api/device-link/validate`: POST validates device link token and returns encrypted backup
- `/api/users`: GET all users
- `/api/users/connected-accounts`: GET linked OAuth providers for current user
- `/api/users/disconnect-account`: POST to unlink OAuth provider
- `/api/users/link-backup`: POST to link backup to OAuth provider
- `/api/users/create-from-backup`: POST to create user record from existing backup
- `/api/users/profile`: GET/PUT user profile data (alternateName, image, description)
- `/api/users/profiles/create`: POST creates new BAP profile (calls newId()) and updates backup
- `/api/users/transfer-oauth`: POST transfers OAuth link from one account to another (requires password verification)

### Environment Variables Required

```env
# Core (Vercel KV provides KV_* automatically)
AUTH_SECRET=your-generated-secret  # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000     # Only needed for local dev

# OAuth Providers (set up at provider's developer console)
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your-github-client-id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your-github-client-secret
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your-google-client-id
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
AUTH_TWITTER_ID=your-twitter-client-id
AUTH_TWITTER_SECRET=your-twitter-client-secret

# Optional
BAP_API_URL=https://sigmaidentity.com/api
```

### Vercel KV Store

This template uses Vercel KV (Redis) which is automatically provisioned when deploying. The following env vars are provided by Vercel:
- `KV_URL`
- `KV_REST_API_URL`
- `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
- `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`

**IMPORTANT**: Upstash Redis (used by Vercel KV) automatically serializes/deserializes JSON:
- When storing objects with `redis.set()`, they are automatically JSON.stringify'd
- When retrieving with `redis.get()`, objects are automatically parsed
- DO NOT manually `JSON.parse()` data from Redis - it's already an object
- Use proper typing: `const data = await redis.get(key) as MyType`

### Redis Key Structure

- `user:{bapId}`: User data (address, idKey, createdAt)
- `backup:{bapId}`: Encrypted backup string
- `backup:{bapId}:metadata`: Backup metadata (lastUpdated, hash)
- `oauth:{provider}:{providerAccountId}`: OAuth to BAP ID mapping
- `addr:{address}`: Address to BAP ID mapping for unpublished profiles
- `bap:{bapId}`: Cached BAP profile data
- `block:height`: Current blockchain height for tracking
- `device-link:{token}`: Time-limited device linking tokens with encrypted backup
- `oauth-state:{state}`: OAuth linking state tokens for CSRF protection
- `pending-backup:{bapId}`: Temporary storage for backups during OAuth linking flow

### Utility Functions

- **verifyProfileOwnership**: Verifies a user owns a specific BAP ID by checking their backup (`lib/profile-utils.ts`)
- **getBapIdsFromBackup**: Extracts all BAP IDs from a backup (`lib/profile-utils.ts`)

### Key UI Components

- **ProfileEditor**: Modal for editing user profile (alternateName, image, description)
- **Homepage**: Dark-themed landing page with animations and feature highlights
- **Dashboard**: User profile display with edit functionality and BAP profile integration
- **Settings**: OAuth provider management for multi-device backup access
- **Security Settings**: Cloud backup management and local backup export
- **DeviceLinkQR**: QR code generator for direct device-to-device linking without OAuth
- **LinkDevice**: Page that handles QR code scanning and password decryption for new devices
- **ProfileSwitcher**: Dropdown component for switching between multiple BAP profiles
- **OAuthConflictModal**: Modal that handles OAuth account conflicts, allowing users to transfer links or switch accounts

### Multi-Profile Support

Users can create and manage multiple BAP profiles (identities) from a single master backup:

1. **Profile Creation**: 
   - Call `/api/users/profiles/create` with decrypted backup and password
   - Uses `bap.newId()` to generate new identity with incremented derivation path
   - API returns complete updated encrypted backup
   - Client must decrypt the returned backup to update sessionStorage
   - Syncs updated backup to cloud storage automatically

2. **Profile Switching**:
   - Dashboard supports dynamic routing: `/dashboard/[bapId]`
   - `/dashboard` defaults to first profile in backup
   - ProfileSwitcher component shows all available profiles
   - Each profile has its own Bitcoin address and can have unique profile data

3. **Authorization**:
   - User must own the BAP ID (exists in their backup) to access a profile
   - Profile-specific actions require auth token signed with that profile's private key
   - Profile updates verify both Bitcoin signature AND backup ownership
   - The `X-Decrypted-Backup` header enables verification of secondary profile ownership
   - Unauthorized access redirects to default dashboard

4. **Data Structure**:
   - Master backup contains array of profile IDs (`backup.ids`)
   - Each profile can have separate BAP profile data in Redis
   - OAuth mappings point to primary (first) profile's backup
   - All profiles share the same encrypted backup file

5. **Important Notes**:
   - Profile data (name, bio, image) is stored separately from the backup
   - Creating new profiles only updates the backup, not user accounts
   - Each profile can be published to blockchain independently
   - OAuth providers always retrieve the complete backup with all profiles

### OAuth Conflict Resolution

When users attempt to link an OAuth account that's already associated with another Bitcoin identity:

1. **Conflict Detection**: System detects duplicate OAuth mappings and returns 409 status
2. **User Options**: OAuthConflictModal presents two choices:
   - **Transfer Link**: Move the OAuth link to current account (requires password verification of the old account)
   - **Switch Account**: Abandon current account and use the existing one
3. **Transfer Process**: 
   - User provides password for the old account
   - System verifies ownership by decrypting the old backup
   - OAuth mapping is updated to point to new account
   - Old account's backup is removed from OAuth provider
4. **Implementation Locations**:
   - Signup flow (`/signup` and `/signup/oauth`)
   - Settings page (`/settings`)
   - Link provider callback includes `existingBapId` in error redirects

### Important Implementation Notes

- **OAuth Providers as "Dumb Storage"**: OAuth is NEVER used for authentication, only as key-value storage for encrypted backups
- **No Mixed Sessions**: A user can only be authenticated via credentials (Bitcoin) OR OAuth, never both simultaneously
- **OAuth Linking Requirements**: User MUST be signed in with credentials provider to link OAuth accounts
- **Error Page Workaround**: Custom OAuth linking flow avoids NextAuth error pages by handling callbacks separately
- **BAP ID as Primary Key**: All user data is keyed by BAP ID, which is derived from the Bitcoin identity
- **Signature Verification**: Uses `bitcoin-auth` library to verify signatures with configurable time windows
- **Profile Updates**: User profile changes update Redis immediately but don't modify the encrypted backup
- **Multi-Profile Sessions**: Active profile determined by URL path, not stored in session
- **OAuth Conflict Handling**: Duplicate OAuth accounts can be resolved via transfer or account switching
- **Multi-Profile Security**: Profile updates require both Bitcoin signature (proving key ownership) AND backup verification (proving profile ownership)
- **Request Body Handling**: API routes read body as text first, then create new Request for auth to avoid stream consumption issues
- **Backup Updates**: When creating new profiles, always decrypt the returned backup to get the complete updated state with proper IDs encoding
